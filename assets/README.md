# Switch Spaceship

A game I built using the fundamentals of OOP.

## Description

To play the game: switch the spaceship to match the color of the incoming ball using the spacebar. You have to be fast!

To make it more challenging I added an alien UFO that comes from the side. Press S to activate the shield and avoid collosion with the UFO.

**Losing condtions:**

- Colliding with the alien without activating the shield.
- Color of the spaceship doesn't match the ball's color at touchpoint.
